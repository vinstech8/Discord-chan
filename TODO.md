# To-Do List Because I Am An Idiot Who Can't Program One For Myself
Small todo list until I have my shit sorted out.

> ### Create a TO-DO command (PRIORITY)
>       Perhaps figure out a way to sync it up with a markdown file
>       Or have it write to a markdown file
>       Idk I really like markdown files. That's just me tho
>       I would have it prompt me several times for usage and I could just add in information
>       Then when i type ;;endl it would just end my statements
>       Maybe that would be better for Aditi though
>       Don't even know if I'll be remaking Aditi ever
>       Maybe Aditi will be my selfbot. Perhaps
> ### Create an INVITE command
>       Have it spit out perm calcs
>       I hate having to check those so it'd be nice if I could just never
>       Ok thanks me

# Other things I should be doing in the future sometime
> ### Refactoring my code (lol funny meme)
>       Redocumenting too?
>       Shit that's even funnier
